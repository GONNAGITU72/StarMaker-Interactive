In this part, two models are generated to obtain word embedding matrix from a text corpus which is the users' comments in the StarMaker app. 
One is the skip-gram model with negative sampling, and the other one is to train the embedding matrix in an LSTM model. 
In order to test the model, we print out the top 8 most similar words for each test word. The similarity is computed by the coveriance of the trained word embedding matrixs. 
And the result shows that skip-gram model performs much better than the LSTM method.
